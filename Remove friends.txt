if (Friend[i].popularity < Friend[i+1].popularity)
delete i th friend

break
if(DeleteFriend == false)
delete the last friend.

Input Format
First line contains T number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N, the
number of friends Christie currently has and K ,the number of friends Christie decides
to delete. Next lines contains popularity of her friends separated by space.

Output Format

{

stck.pop_back();

x++;

}

stck.push_back(y);

}

while(x<k)

{

stck.pop_back();

x++;

}

for(int i=0;i<stck.size();i++)

cout<<stck[i]<<" ";
